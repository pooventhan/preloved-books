  description: "<p>The Buddha taught that to live is to experience suffering. Few family sagas, especially first ones, have captured this aspect of suffering and so many other truths in as lyric a fashion as &quot;When Memory Dies&quot;. Through the viewpoints of three generations of a Sri Lankan family (taking the reader from 1920 through the 1980s), Sivanandan explores a culture destroyed first by colonization, then through the ethnic divisions that are released when the country achieves independence. The family, which lives at a level of poverty that makes survival a constant struggle, must also balance love for one another with a deep love of their homeland. Without bending to romanticism or proselytization, the author evokes a compelling and very human story of a lost country. It is a vision as beautifully told as it is unrelenting in its devotion to truth. In the process, the work also supplies a rich historic background to the often underreported news accounts of the massacres and upheavals in Sri Lanka. </p>"

When his father dies, Anil becomes the de facto head of the Patel household and inherits the mantle of arbiter for all of the village&apos;s disputes.

Though Anil and Leena struggle to come to terms with their identities thousands of miles apart, their lives eventually intersect once more-changing them both and the people they love forever. &nbsp;Tender and bittersweet, The Golden Son illuminates the ambivalence of people caught between past and present, tradition and modernity, duty and choice; the push and pull of living in two cultures, and the painful decisions we must make to find our true selves. </p>"

  description: "<p>When Shoba Narayan - who has just returned to India with her husband and two daughters after years in the United States - asks whether said cow might bless her apartment next, it is the beginning of a beautiful friendship between our author and Sarala, who also sells fresh milk right across the street from that thoroughly modern apartment building. The two women connect over not only cows but also family, food, and life. When Shoba agrees to buy Sarala a new cow, they set off looking for just the right heifer, and what was at first a simple economic transaction becomes something much deeper, though never without a hint of slapstick.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Milk Lady of Bangalore immerses us in the culture, customs, myths, religion, sights, and sounds of a city in which the twenty-first century and the ancient past coexist like nowhere else in the world. It&apos;s a true story of bridging divides, of understanding other ways of looking at the world, and of human connections and animal connections, and it&apos;s an irresistible adventure of two strong women and the animals they love. </p>"

  description: "<p>&quot;After half a century,&quot; writes renowned Indonesia scholar Benedict Anderson, &quot;Pramoedya Ananta Toer has found a successor.&quot; Eka Kurniawan has been described as the &quot;brightest meteorite&quot; in Indonesia&apos;s new literary firmament, the author of two remarkable novels whose sheer beauty, elegance, cosmopolitanism, and ambition have brought comparisons not only to Pramoedya, universally considered Indonesia&apos;s modern literary genius, but also to Salman Rushdie, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, and Mark Twain. A new generation of young literary figures in Indonesia, emerging after decades of repressive dictatorship ended in 1998, is renewing the culture of the world&apos;s largest Muslim nation (and its language, which was only nationally instituted in 1945). Kurniawan&apos;s Beauty Is a Wound and Man Tiger are the capstones of this movement. A slim, wry story set in an unnamed town near the Indian Ocean, Man Tiger tells the story of two interlinked and tormented families, and of Margio, an ordinary half-city, half-rural youngster who also happens to be half-man, half-supernatural female white tiger (in many parts of Indonesia, magical tigers protect good villages and families).At once elegant and bawdy, experimental and political, Man Tiger will help to establish Indonesia&apos;s new voice, underrepresented in world literature, while demonstrating the influence of world literature on Indonesian writers.</p>"

  description: "<p>Expos&eacute; of the red-light districts of Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia) as well as in Bangkok (Thailand) and Batam and Karimun Islands (Indonesia). Part of the bestselling Undercover series, including Bali Undercover and Jakarta Undercover (vols. I &amp; II). As eight sexy girls strut their stuff on stage, spandex shorts swathing their behinds as tightly as the lotus-leaf wrappings of a Chinese dumpling, author Ewe Paik Leong once again finds himself on the trail of Kuala Lumpur s ladies of the night. Following the success of his original book, which resulted in several red-light areas being closed down by the Malaysian authorities, he is back with new girls, new locations and new, shocking material. In Kuala Lumpur Undercover II, the author reveals websites where freelancers sporting Islamic hijab headscarves advertise their services and, in true Malaysian fashion, where the names of dishes are used to denote the different races: nasi lemak for Malay girls, char kwey teow for Chinese, and chapati for Indians. He visits KL s ethnic enclaves and interviews sex workers in Little Vietnam , Little Indonesia , Little China and Little Nepal . The author also travels north to Thailand to report on activities in Bangkok and Phuket, and south to the Indonesian islands of Batam and Karimun, both a short hop from Singapore. On Karimun Island, he visits a self-contained prostitution village, or lokalisasi, where women idle under front porches of houses and wait for business while feathered chickens scratch the dirt looking for their next victim.</p>"
